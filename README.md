College Admission Management System

Description

The College Admission Management System is a simple Java-based project that helps manage students, courses, and admission applications using a MySQL database.
It allows you to:

    Add and view students

    Add and view courses

    Submit admission applications

    Automatically approve or reject applications based on student marks and course cut-off

This project is built using Core Java and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for handling MySQL database operations.
It’s designed to help beginners understand how to connect Java applications to a database and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Features

    Add new students with their marks

    Add courses with their cutoff marks

    Apply for a course

    Approve or reject applications based on eligibility

    View all students, courses, and applications from the database
